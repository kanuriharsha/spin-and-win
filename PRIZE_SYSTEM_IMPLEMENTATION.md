# Prize System Complete Implementation Guide

## ✅ CURRENT STATUS: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

All prize data (type and amount) is being saved to both `wheels` and `spinResults` collections!

---

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Schemas Updated ✅

**Wheels Collection** - Each segment now stores:
- `prizeType`: String (enum: 'cash', 'loyalty', 'other')
- `amount`: String (e.g., "₹500", "30 Loyalty Points")

**SpinResults Collection** - Each result now stores:
- `winner`: Prize name
- `prizeType`: Type of prize won
- `prizeAmount`: Amount/details of prize
- `userId`: Link to user (for loyalty points)

**Users Collection** - New collection for loyalty tracking:
- `loyaltyPoints`: Total accumulated points
- `pointsHistory`: Array of all transactions

### 2. Backend Routes Updated ✅

- `normalizeSegments()` preserves all segment fields including prizeType and amount
- Spin endpoint saves complete prize details to spinResults
- Result endpoint accepts and saves prize information
- Loyalty points system creates/updates user records

### 3. Frontend Updated ✅

**Editor Page:**
- Prize Type dropdown (Cash/Loyalty/Other)
- Amount input field for each segment
- All data saved to wheel segments

**CustomWheel Page:**
- Displays prize amount in winner modal
- Sends complete prize details to backend
- Shows amount in winner banner

---

## How to Use

### For Editors (Creating Wheels):

1. **Open Editor** (`/editor` or `/editor/:id`)
2. **Select a segment** from the list
3. **Set Prize Details:**
   - Choose **Prize Type**: Cash Prize / Loyalty Points / Other Prize
   - Enter **Amount/Details**: e.g., "₹500" or "30 Loyalty Points"
4. **Save the wheel**

The system automatically saves `prizeType` and `amount` to the database.

### For Users (Spinning):

1. User fills form and clicks "SPIN"
2. Wheel spins and selects a winner
3. System saves complete prize details to database:
   - Winner name
   - Prize type
   - Prize amount

### For Loyalty Points:

1. Editor creates segment with:
   - Prize Type: "Loyalty Points"
   - Amount: "30 Loyalty Points" (or any number)
2. When user wins:
   - System extracts the number (30)
   - Finds or creates user by surname + name
   - Adds 30 to their loyalty balance
   - Records transaction in history
   - Links userId in spinResults

## Database Verification

### Check Wheels Have Prize Data:
```javascript
db.wheels.findOne(
  { routeName: "bawarchi" },
  { 
    "segments.text": 1,
    "segments.prizeType": 1,
    "segments.amount": 1
  }
)
```

### Check SpinResults Have Prize Data:
```javascript
db.spinResults.find(
  { winner: { $exists: true } },
  {
    winner: 1,
    prizeType: 1,
    prizeAmount: 1,
    surname: 1,
    outTime: 1
  }
).sort({ outTime: -1 }).limit(5)
```

### Check Users with Loyalty Points:
```javascript
db.users.find(
  {},
  {
    surname: 1,
    name: 1,
    loyaltyPoints: 1,
    pointsHistory: 1
  }
)
```

---

## For Existing Wheels (Migration)

If you have existing wheels created before this update, run the migration script to add default prize fields:

```bash
cd backend
node migrate-wheel-segments.js
```

This adds:
- `prizeType: 'other'` to all existing segments
- `amount: ''` (empty string) to all existing segments

Then editors can update these values through the UI.
